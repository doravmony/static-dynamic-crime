## Motivation

1.  *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*

    -   The dataset was created to analyze crime trends in Toronto, with a focus on temporal and spatial variations in crime rates. This fills the gap in understanding crime distributions at the neighborhood level over a decade.

2.  *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*

    -   The dataset was compiled by Weiyang Li as part of an academic project at the University of Toronto.

3.  *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*

    -   This work was self-funded as part of a graduate-level research project.

4.  *Any other comments?*

    -   None.

## Composition

1.  *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*

    -   Each instance represents a reported crime in a specific Toronto neighborhood, categorized by type and year.

2.  *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*

    -   The dataset includes over 13,000 rows, representing annual summaries of crime counts for various crime types across Toronto neighborhoods.

3.  *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?*

    -   The dataset includes all available records for reported crimes in Toronto from 2014 to 2023.

4.  *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features?*

    -   Each instance consists of cleaned and processed features, including crime counts, crime rates per 1,000 population, and neighborhood population data.

5.  *Is there a label or target associated with each instance?*

    -   The main targets are crime counts and crime rates per 1,000 population.

6.  *Is any information missing from individual instances?*

    -   Instances with missing data for population or crime counts were removed during preprocessing.

7.  *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit?*

    -   No direct relationships between instances are modeled, but data can be grouped by neighborhood or year for analysis.

8.  *Are there recommended data splits?*

    -   Yes, a 70:30 split into training and test datasets is recommended for modeling.

9.  *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset?*

    -   Some minor inconsistencies may exist due to underreporting or variations in data collection methods.

10. *Is the dataset self-contained?*

    -   Yes, the dataset is self-contained and does not rely on external resources.

11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential?*

    -   No confidential data is included.

12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety?*

    -   The dataset includes crime data, which may cause anxiety for some users.

13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations?*

    -   The dataset includes crime data grouped by neighborhood, but no demographic sub-populations are identified.

14. *Is it possible to identify individuals?*

    -   No, the dataset is anonymized and does not include identifiable information.

15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way?*

    -   The dataset contains crime data, which could be considered sensitive.

16. *Any other comments?*

    -   None.

## Collection Process

1.  *How was the data associated with each instance acquired?*

    -   Data was sourced from publicly available government repositories, such as Toronto Police Service and Statistics Canada.

2.  *What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data?*

    -   Data was downloaded via APIs or directly from data portals and cleaned using R scripts.

3.  *If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy?*

    -   Not applicable; the dataset includes all available instances.

4.  *Who was involved in the data collection process?*

    -   The dataset was collected and processed by the author.

5.  *Over what timeframe was the data collected?*

    -   The dataset covers crimes reported between 2014 and 2023.

6.  *Were any ethical review processes conducted?*

    -   Not applicable; the dataset is based on publicly available data.

7.  *Did you collect the data from the individuals in question directly, or obtain it via third parties or other sources?*

    -   Data was obtained from third-party government sources.

8.  *Were the individuals in question notified about the data collection?*

    -   Not applicable; the data is anonymized.

9.  *Did the individuals in question consent to the collection and use of their data?*

    -   Not applicable; the data is anonymized.

10. *If consent was obtained, were the consenting individuals provided with a mechanism to revoke their consent?*

    -   Not applicable.

## Preprocessing/Cleaning/Labeling

1.  *Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done?*

    -   Yes, missing values were removed, columns were normalized, and crime rates were calculated per 1,000 population.

2.  *Was the "raw" data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data?*

    -   Yes, raw data is saved in "data/01-raw_data/".
