# Analyzing Crime Trends in Toronto (2014–2023): Data, Models, and Insights

## Overview

This repository supports the project analyzing crime trends in Toronto (2014–2023). The study investigates temporal and spatial variations in crime types, uncovering significant patterns and providing actionable insights for policymakers. The repository includes all data, scripts, and outputs necessary to reproduce the analyses and results presented in the study.

## File Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

-  `data/raw_data`: Contains the raw data obtained from the Toronto Police Service Public Safety Data Portal and other sources.

-  `data/analysis_data`: Includes the cleaned and processed dataset used for analysis. Data transformations, normalizations, and variable constructions are documented in the Appendix.

-  `model`: Contains the fitted models, including static and dynamic Bayesian hierarchical models used to analyze crime trends.

-  `other`: Includes relevant sketches, documentation, and additional notes about project workflows, including LLM-assisted content creation.

-  `paper`: Contains the Quarto source files, bibliography, and final PDF of the report detailing the study findings.

-  `scripts`: Holds R scripts used for data cleaning, visualization, modeling, and analysis.

## Statement on LLM Usage

Aspects of this project were developed using LLM tools, including ChatGPT to streamline code generation, enhance documentation, and refine analyses. The abstract, introduction, and other sections were iteratively developed with DeepL and Grammarly assistance. Full interaction logs are available in other/llms/usage.txt.
