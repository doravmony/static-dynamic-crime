# Supplier Pricing and Promotion Analysis

## Overview

This project explores pricing strategies, promotional impacts, and temporal price trends across different suppliers. The analysis leverages statistical and machine learning methods to address key research questions and uncover actionable insights.

## Research Questions

We are investigating the following key questions:

Are pricing strategies consistent across suppliers? Can supplier influence on prices be differentiated into commodity-level and supplier-level differences?
Did the sale actually increase sales (using indirect metrics such as “stock status”)?
Are there cyclical or trend fluctuations in commodity prices? Do promotions occur more frequently at particular points in time?
Is the price of an item affected by multiple interacting factors such as Sale, Brand, Unit size, etc.?
Do prices change significantly over time? Do price fluctuations trend consistently across suppliers? Is the supplier's price impact dynamic in the time dimension?
We will focus on three of these questions for detailed analysis.
